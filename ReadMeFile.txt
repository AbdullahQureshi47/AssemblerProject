Project: Assembler Project

What it does: The project takes in assembly language, in this program MIPS, and converts it into Machine code (binary numbers).

How it runs:

In order to start the project we need to open the Unix/Linux terminal and reach the project folder. Then we compile the
code by doing a make all. After compiling we need to test the Program. We test the program using the following commands:

1) ./testPass1 smallSampleTestfile.txt
2) ./testPass1 testFile.txt                   (Either command works)

Each of these commands test these particular test cases included in each file.

The output of these testFiles would be as follows:

However, currently our program does not show the machine code and it returns the labels and their addresses. It is because our function does not enter pass2.c
at all and I am guessing it might be due to some errors in our main file.

Overall, our code works as we have shown it to multiple TA's and students but no one was able to figure out the problem. We are using pass2.c in the main
file (testPass1.c) however, it still doesn't run it.

For our output from the assembler project gives the address location and the number of labels.
